This project was inspired by Lauren Tierney’s and Tim Meko’s piece “[How much is 250,000 deaths? Enough to empty wide swaths of the country.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/11/20/250000-covid-deaths-map/?arc404=true)” The map design and grid-based layout is based on Brendan Sudol’s “[Presidential Pick’em](https://brendansudol.com/electoral-map-viz/#)."
